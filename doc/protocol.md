# wspulse Wire Protocol

Version: 0 (unstable — evolves until v1)

---

## Transport

wspulse uses RFC 6455 WebSocket as the transport layer. Clients connect using
any standard WebSocket library; no custom handshake is required beyond the
standard HTTP Upgrade.

---

## Frame Format (JSON codec — default)

Every message exchanged between server and client is a **Frame** encoded as a
JSON object in a WebSocket **text** frame:

```json
{
  "id":      "<uuid or empty>",
  "type":    "<string>",
  "payload": <any valid JSON value>
}
```

| Field     | Required | Description                                                            |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`      | No       | Opaque string used for ACK correlation. Omitted if empty.              |
| `type`    | No       | Application-defined string classifying the frame purpose.              |
| `payload` | No       | Any valid JSON value. The wspulse layer does not interpret this field. |

All fields are optional at the transport layer. Their semantics are defined by
the application layer built on top of wspulse.

### Suggested type values

These are conventions only — applications may use any string:

| Value   | Meaning                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `"msg"` | User-generated data message                    |
| `"sys"` | System or control event                        |
| `"ack"` | Acknowledgement of a previously received frame |

### Example frames

Chat message (server → client):

```json
{
  "id": "01JXABC",
  "type": "msg",
  "payload": { "text": "hello", "user": "alice" }
}
```

System event (server → client):

```json
{
  "id": "01JXABD",
  "type": "sys",
  "payload": { "event": "member_join", "user_id": "bob" }
}
```

Acknowledgement (client → server):

```json
{ "type": "ack", "payload": { "id": "01JXABC" } }
```

## Frame Format (Custom codec)

When a custom `Codec` is injected via `WithCodec`, messages are sent as
WebSocket **binary** or **text** frames depending on the codec's `FrameType()`
return value. The `Codec` interface handles encoding and decoding; wspulse is
agnostic to the on-wire format (Protobuf, MessagePack, CBOR, etc.).

---

## Heartbeat

The server sends a WebSocket **Ping** control frame every `pingPeriod`
(default 10 s). Clients must respond with a **Pong**; standard WebSocket
libraries handle this automatically. If no Pong is received within `pongWait`
(default 30 s), the server closes the connection.

---

## Connection Lifecycle

```
Client                           Server
  |                                |
  |--- HTTP GET /ws (Upgrade) ---> |
  |<-- 101 Switching Protocols --- |
  |                                |
  |     [frames exchanged]         |
  |                                |
  |--- Ping <--------------------- |  (every pingPeriod)
  |--- Pong --------------------> |
  |                                |
  |--- Close frame -------------> |  (normal close by client)
  |<-- Close frame --------------- |
  |                                |
```

Abnormal closure (network drop, server-side Kick) terminates the TCP
connection and triggers the `OnDisconnect` callback on the server side.

---

## Session Resumption

When `WithResumeWindow` is configured, a disconnected client may reconnect
using the same `connectionID` (as returned by `ConnectFunc`) within the resume
window. The server transparently swaps the underlying WebSocket and replays
any frames buffered during the gap. **No changes to the wire protocol are
required** — the reconnect is a standard HTTP Upgrade with the same
`connectionID` negotiated via `ConnectFunc`.

The server does **not** fire `OnConnect` or `OnDisconnect` callbacks during a
successful resume. From the application layer's perspective, the `Connection`
never dropped.

## Versioning

This protocol document is versioned alongside the wspulse module. Breaking
changes to the wire format will increment the major version of the module.
